This section outlines the key concepts needed to fulfil the mission requirements of the BMFA Payload Challenge by extracting the relevant parameters from the competition guidelines. Initially, a sizing chart is produced to help visualise the minimum performance and specify the characteristics of the aircraft. To begin the concept selection, rankings are given to each individual aircraft component, in accordance to the competition requirements. Comparisons will also be made between individual aircraft components, by undergoing a morphological analysis, using the parameters extracted from the BMFA competition guidelines. This will ensure that the best concepts will be selected to fulfil the mission requirements.
