The score multiplier for each assessment criteria is based on the criteria's relevance to the objectives set out by the BMFA. As the scoring of the competition is based entirely on the ratio between payload and OWE, the score multiplier for weight has the greatest influence on the overall score relative to the other factors. Another rule, where relevant, is the ability for the payload to be removed which leads to this factor having a high score multiplier. Other assessable factors which are relevant to each of the components are ease of manufacture and assembly along with repairability, which need to be considered when choosing a configuration to ensure its feasibility.

The score range for each of the criteria is from 1 to 5 with a score of 5 being most favourable, 3 being average and 1 being poor. The score given for each criteria is based on the relative performance of all of the configurations being considered.

## Landing Gear

In order for the aircraft to support its own weight, including that of the payload, the durability and shock resistance of the undercarriage upon landing has been given the highest score multiplier [[Mouritz, 2012]](/docs/references). This ensures that the aircraft can perform nominally for all three required circuits.

In terms of ground stability, a taildragger would offer more than an in-board tricycle undercarriage [[Monroe Aerospace, 2020]](/docs/references), and hence reduces the risk of toppling during landing and take-off. Although a wing-mounted tricycle configuration would be more beneficial in this regard, it looses points in the remaining parameters. Despite a taildragger's tendency to nose-over if handled incorrectly [[McDowell, 2021]](/docs/references), its ease of assembly and repairability gives an advantage compared to the more durable tricycle configuration.
