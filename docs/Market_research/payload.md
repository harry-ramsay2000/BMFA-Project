The payload requirement for this design challenge is to carry a liquid payload of up to 4kg. This will be done with two tests in 2kg increments. There is currently very little literature provided for liquid cargo transportation. The payload receptacle must be removable from the aircraft. Options for carrying the payload include containing the liquid in the fuselage or wing. For this to happen the structure will need to be secure and water tight in these particular areas. The payload can also be carried externally, however, there is risk during the flight test of potentially damaging the container during take-off and landing. Designing the payload receptacle will need the most creativity as the aim is to keep OWE as low as possible. Everyday items like bags and bottles can be considered due to their lightness, durability, accessibility and low cost.
