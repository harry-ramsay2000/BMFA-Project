### Conventional Tail
A conventional tail is the most common and simplest configuration used in aircraft. As the tail only consists of two components, one horizontal surface and one vertical, it is easy to manufacture and also has a low structural weight. The configuration provides adequate stability and control to perform all tail functions.

### V-Tail
A V-tail configuration has the advantage of reduced drag because of its reduced total tail area. It is also lighter than most of the other tail configurations which will have an impact on the overall OWE. The main disadvantage of a V-Tail is its complex control system as the rudder and elevator (ruddervator) controls must be combined. As a result, the aircraft is more prone to adverse roll-yaw. A reverse V-Tail design can be used to eliminate this effect. V-Tail designs are also more susceptible to Dutch roll than any other tail design.

### T-Tail
A T-Tail configuration benefits from a horizontal tail plane which would not be affected by the wing vortices making it highly efficient. Similar to the conventional tail, it only consists of two components, which makes design and manufacture easy. The two main drawbacks of this design are deep stall and its weight. As the vertical tail must support the horizontal tail, it needs to be strengthened making the vertical tail heavier.

### H-Tail
The benefit of H-Tail configuration is its improved aerodynamic performance of the horizontal tail due to its vertical tail end plates. The drawback of this configuration is its structural design is more complex than the conventional tail which can make the manufacturing process difficult and time-consuming. It is also heavier when compared to the conventional and T-Tail designs as the horizontal tail must be able to support both vertical tails.
