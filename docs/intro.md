# Project Introduction
This site aims to document the design, manufacture and eventual flight test and competition of an aircraft built as part of a Masters aeronautical degree course. The aircraft is designed and build for competition in the British Model Flying Asociation's *Design, Build, Fly* Payload Challenge. The challenge requires an aircraft with a specified motor and battery to carry four kilograms of liquid payload around a specified circuit.
