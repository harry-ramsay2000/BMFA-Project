This report considers the key conceptual design parameters needed to design a competitive aircraft for the 2022 BMFA Payload Challenge. The final configuration from [Concept Design One](/docs/Concept1/Introduction) will be the basis for further development. Aerofoil selection is to be carried out along with analysis of sweep, taper, and aspect ratio, resulting in an initial planform. A weight estimate, including CG analysis, will allow for propeller sizing bearing in mind the provided electronics which will also be discussed. Additionally, the location of the intended landing gear configuration will be considered, concluding in the creation of a three view technical drawing on the conceptual aircraft design.
