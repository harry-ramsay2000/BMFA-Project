The estimated useable area for storage of the main electrical components
(battery and motor) along with the positioning of the additional payload
is indicated by the shaded region in figure
[1]. The
anticipated usable volume was calculated by taking the summation of the
cross sectional areas of the aerofoil within the shaded region; where in
the crank region the area was taken up to 70% chord and after the crank
up to 60% chord due to the use of a thinner section after the crank. The
area was not taken for the whole aerofoil section due to the tapering of
the trailing edge resulting in the space not being feasible to use as
storage, in a similar fashion the useable area is only taken up to 60%
of the span due to the tapering of the wing.
