As discussed, the longer the servo arm, the higher the torque requirement - this means that the servo should be located as close to the control surface as possible. With the control surfaces located on the trailing edge of the aerofoil sections, the thickness is very narrow and so a smaller servo would be able to get closer and therefore require less torque. A smaller servo motor will usually provide less torque, and so it will be necessary to see how the trade-off between size and torque plays out in determining the servo location and size. Additionally, a larger servo motor, whilst providing more torque, will weigh more. Not only is the physical size going to cause an increase in weight, some higher torque rated servo motors use metal gears over lighter nylon gears in order to reduce the chance of shredding the teeth. With the aim of the challenge to minimise the operating weight of the aircraft, it will be important to select the lightest servo possible, whilst not risking the controllability of the aircraft in high-load conditions."))}h.isMDXComponent=!0},5548:function(e,t,r){t.Z=r.p+"assets/images/Initial_System-44769f23a60472a7ca9457b6a133bad5.png"}}]);
