Friday saw the start of the teams wind tunnel testing. The day was spent setting the model up and ensuring the function of the test facilities. The team aims to use this testing time to validate the theoretical aerodynamic performance as ensure the suitability of the current planform for the competition design.

Testing is to be carried out in the T2 wind tunnel at City and make use of the 6 component force balance for quantitative data acquisition with surface oil flow visualisation done to further understanding of the air flow around the model. The tests will be performed at a range of Reynolds numbers appropriate to the mission flight conditions.
